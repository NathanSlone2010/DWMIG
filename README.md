This project is entirely legal and exists solely for the purposes of safety, education, and responsible knowledge sharing. It is not intended for any unlawful activity, and I strongly urge all users to respect this intent. Please do not misuse or exploit this project for illegal or harmful purposes [While I cannot legally enforce how it is used ;)].

The continued development and maintenance of this project depend on the generous support of donations. Your contributions help cover costs and ensure that this resource—and my ability to work on it—remain sustainable. That said, donations are completely voluntary and are not required to access or benefit from this project. The term “donation” is used deliberately: it reflects a choice, not an obligation. Your support is appreciated, but it should never feel coerced.
